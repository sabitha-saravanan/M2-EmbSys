## 1. INTRODUCTION

Home automation focuses on making it possible for older adults and people with disabilities to remain at home, safe and comfortable. Home automation is becoming a viable option for older adults and people with disabilities who would prefer to stay in the comfort of their homes. Most of the people choose an easy way to reduce the time and effort. Automating the home is the easiest method to reduce the time and effort of the peoples. This system uses voice commands to operate the electrical home appliances. An android application is used to capture the voice commands using Google voice assistant.
The system uses Bluetooth module for transmitting data for controlling the function of electrical loads. The Bluetooth can receive input signal from a device which have Bluetooth compatibility such as smartphone. The smart home automation is most beneficial for handicapped or aged people. The system solve the problem of switching on/off electrical appliances because when user just have to give voice command to control the appliance or electrical loads.
The system is designed in such a way user can control all appliances at once or can control each separately. The system works by interfacing on/off switches of electrical appliance or loads by using mechanical relay or solid state relay, after connecting relays in system the electrical switch works as two way switch. The voice command is sent by using a software designed for controlling the system, a built in microphone and voice recognition system implemented in device. A micro-controller (Arduino Uno) is implemented in system, the micro controller receives input signal from user device and send signal to respective relay for turning on/off electrical appliances connected with system such as bulbs, fan, air conditioner unit etc. It helps those people who are sick, bedridden, physically disabled or elderly to easily operate the home appliances. It will be an easiest method for them to turn on/off the home appliances from where they are. Most people find it difficult and lazy to walk near the switch, to turn on light, fan or any other home appliances.

## 1.1 ABSTRACT

With advancement of Automation technology, life is getting simpler and easier in all aspects. In todayâ€™s world, Automatic systems are being preferred over manual system. There is a rapid increase in the number of users of internet over the past decade. This has made internet a part and parcel of life, and IoT is the latest and emerging internet technology. Internet of things is a growing network of everyday object-from industrial machine to consumer goods that can share information and complete tasks with other activities. Wireless Home Automation system using IoT is a system that uses computers or mobile devices to control basic home functions and features automatically through internet from anywhere around the world, an automated home is sometimes called a smart home. It is meant to save the electric power and human energy. The home automation system differs from other system by allowing the user to operate the system from anywhere around the world through internet connection.

## 1.2 SWOT ANALYSIS

## STRENGTH

i) With ability to adjust your thermostat and lights with your voice

ii) Gain more control over how much energy your home uses at a given time.

iii) save money and live more cost- effectively

## WEAKNESS

i) Many voice controlled systems are not completely hands free.

ii) Voice control systems that run on mobile devices still require you to press a button on your device before you can issue a command.

## OPPURTUNITIES

i) Home automation allows us to control hosehold electrical applicances like light,door,fan,AC etc.

ii)It also provides home security and emergency system to be activated.

## THREATS

i) According to rambus a premier silicon intellectual property and chip provider,an estimated 80% of internet of things devices are vulnerable to one of the many attack scenarios.

ii) These devices for the most part, present very little security risk when used as stand-alone devices and not connected to the internet.

iii) These stand-alone devices introduce numerous cyber security risks.

## 1.3 4W'S & 1H

## WHO

Home automation can be used by all age group people.

## WHAT

Home automation gives access to control devices in your home from a mobile devices anywhere.

## WHEN

It can be used anytime

## WHERE

It can be working only you are connected the bluetooth to AMR voice device

## HOW

First you need to install the AMR voice app,next choose bluetooth option and connect robot after successful connection the device are ready to transmit data. Next press the microphone icon on AMR voice app and start giving commands.
