## COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS:

## Arduino UNO  
 i) Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. There are many other microcontrollers and microcontroller platforms available for physical computing
 
 ii) The Arduino Uno contains asset of analog and digital pins that are input and output pins which are used to connect the board to other components. The boar has 14 digital I/O pins (six capable of PWM output), 6 analog I/O pins, and is programmable with Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment).The board has a USB connection that can be used to a power supply to the board. The board is used for electronics projects and used to design circuit. Arduino Uno is a low cost, flexible, and easy to use programmable open source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronics projects.

 ## HC-05 Bluetooth module
 i) HC-Bluetooth module is an easy to use Bluetooth Serial port protocol (SPP) module, designed for transparent wireless serial connection setup .It provides switching between master and slave mode which means it is able to use neither receiving nor transmitting data. It uses 2.45GHZ frequency band .The transfer rate of the data can vary up to 1Mbps and it is in range of 10 meters.
 
 ii) The HC-05 module can be operated within 4-6V of power supply. Designed to replace cable connections to communicate with the electronics.Usually, it is used to connect small devices like mobiles using a short range of wireless connection to exchange files.This module works on 3.3 V. We can connect 5V supply voltage as well since the module has on board 5 to 3.3 V regulator.

 ## 2N2222 Transistor
  i) The 2N2222 is a common NPN bipolar junction transistors (BJT) used for general purpose low-power amplifying or switching applications. It is designed for low to medium current, low power, medium voltage, and can operate at moderately high speeds. The 2N2222 transistors is made of either germanium or silicon that has been saturated with either a positively or negatively changed material process called as doping. 
  
 ii) The 2N2222 has a positively charged section between two negatively charged sections. The resulting two connections between the three sections are where the 2N2222 derives the name bipolar junction transistors. The materials used are arranged in the order of negative, positive, then so the devices is also said to be NPN transistors.
