 ###                                                  HOME AUTOMATION FOR DISABLED PERSON USING HIS VOICE TAG
 
### REQUIREMENTS 

### INTRODUCTION

Home automation focuses on making it possible for older adults and people with disabilities to remain at home, safe and comfortable. Home automation is becoming a viable option for older adults and people with disabilities who would prefer to stay in the comfort of their homes. Most of the people choose an easy way to reduce the time and effort. Automating the home is the easiest method to reduce the time and effort of the peoples. This system uses voice commands to operate the electrical home appliances. An android application is used to capture the voice commands using Google voice assistant.

The system uses Bluetooth module for transmitting data for controlling the function of electrical loads. The Bluetooth can receive input signal from a device which have Bluetooth compatibility such as smartphone. The smart home automation is most beneficial for handicapped or aged people. The system solve the problem of switching on/off electrical appliances because when user just have to give voice command to control the appliance or electrical loads.

The system is designed in such a way user can control all appliances at once or can control each separately. The system works by interfacing on/off switches of electrical appliance or loads by using mechanical relay or solid state relay, after connecting relays in system the electrical switch works as two way switch. The voice command is sent by using a software designed for controlling the system, a built in microphone and voice recognition system implemented in device. A micro-controller (Arduino Uno) is implemented in system, the micro controller receives input signal from user device and send signal to respective relay for turning on/off electrical appliances connected with system such as bulbs, fan, air conditioner unit etc.It helps those people who are sick, bedridden, physically disabled or elderly to easily operate the home appliances. It will be an easiest method for them to turn on/off the home appliances from where they are. Most people find it difficult and lazy to walk near the switch, to turn on light, fan or any other home appliances. 

### OBJECTIVES
 
 Gadget controlling by switch or remote is old idea now. we can control anyn home apparatuses by utilizing our voice. the fundamental point of this venture is to control light, fan,bulb and so forth utilizing human voice. the physically cripple individuals are not working home machines utilizing hands. this venture is extremely valuable for physically incapacitated/physically inpair individual. they are skilled to work home machines by utilizing their voice.A portion of the target of venture is composed underneath
 
  i) On the off chance that you dealt with a home mechanism framework by building a cell phone particular an android gadgets.
  
  ii) The plan and usage of financially savvy mechanization framework still complling.
  
  iii) To plan an easy to understand and can work a sheltered framework for home machines for the most part engaged to help seniors and debilitated.

### HISTORY

Home automation is building automation for a home called smart home or smart house.A home automation system will monitor or control homes attributes such as lightining,climate,appliances.It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems.When connected to internet home devices are an important constituent of the internet of things.The idea or concept of first smart home has explored in science fiction for decades. The originally first smart home was not actual architecture but only an idea. Although the concept of smart home automation has been around for quite a long time, but an actual smart home has only established a short time. The invention of home appliances such as a television with a remote control which is a simple home automation system was patented in 1893. Other than that, more home appliances have been invented since that. In early 2000, the popularity of smart home automation began to increase due to different of technology started to arise. Smart home automation turns into a more affordable choice and therefore a viable or available technology for consumers. With the uprising of the prestige of smart home, home networking, domestic technologies and other gadgets began to emerge on store shelves

### EQUIPMENTS

A home automation system combines hardware and software via wireless network to control hoe electronics and appliances through one device which could be a smart phone, tablet, or aspecified central automation control hub.These devices can be controlled remotely.

### SWOT ANALYSIS

## STRENGTH

i)  With ability to adjust your thermostat and lights with your voice

ii) Gain more control over how much energy your home uses at a given time.

iii) save money and live more cost- effectively

## WEAKNESS
i) Many voice controlled systems are not completely hands free.

ii) Voice control systems that run on mobile devices still require you to press a button on your device before you can issue a command.

## OPPURTUNITIES
i) Home automation allows us to control hosehold electrical applicances like light, door, fan, AC etc.

ii)It also provides home security and emergency system to be activated.

## THREATS
i) According to rambus a premier silicon intellectual property and chip provider,an estimated 80% of internet of things devices are vulnerable to one of the many attack scenarios.

ii) These devices for the most part, present very little security risk when usedas stand-alone devices and not connected to the internet

iii) These stand alone devices introduce numerous cyber security risks.

### 4W'S & 1H

## WHO

Home automation can be used by all age group people.

## WHAT

Home automation gives access to control devices in your home from a mobile devices anywhere.

## WHEN

It can be used anytime

## WHERE

It can be working only you are connected the bluetooth to AMR voice device
