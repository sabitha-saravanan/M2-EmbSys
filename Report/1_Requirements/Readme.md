This system uses voice commands to operate the electrical home appliances. An android application is used to capture the voice commands using Google voice assistant.
         The system uses Bluetooth module for transmitting data for controlling the function of electrical loads. The Bluetooth can receive input signal from a device which have Bluetooth compatibility such as smartphone. The smart home automation is most beneficial for handicapped or aged people. The system solve the problem of switching on/off electrical appliances because when user just have to give voice command to control the appliance or electrical loads. 
         The system is designed in such a way user can control all appliances at once or can control each separately. The system works by interfacing on/off switches of electrical appliance or loads by using mechanical relay or solid state relay, after connecting relays in system the electrical switch works as two way switch. The voice command is sent by using a software designed for controlling the system, a built in microphone and voice recognition system implemented in device. A micro-controller (Arduino Uno) is implemented in system, the micro controller receives input signal from user device and send signal to respective relay for turning on/off electrical appliances connected with system such as bulbs, fan, air conditioner unit etc
         It helps those people who are sick, bedridden, physically disabled or elderly to easily operate the home appliances. It will be an easiest method for them to turn on/off the home appliances from where they are.
