## Applications of Arduino UNO: 

 Arduino as a good device for developing interactive object, talking inputs from a variety of switches or sensors and controlling a variety of lights, motors and other outputs.

 Arduino can be stand alone or they can be connceted to a computer using USB.The arduino will be seen by the computer as a standard series interface.

 The arduino board is a microcontroller board which is a small circuit that contains whole computer and a small chip.

## Applications of HC-05:

	Wireless communication between two microcontrollers

	Communicate with laptop, desktops and mobile phones

	Data logging application 

	Consumer applications

	Wireless robots 

	Home Automation

## Applications of 2N2222 Transistor:

 This 2N2222 transistor could be used in that loads where current is required more than 800mA'

 Motor drive circuits such as variable frequency drives (VFD) etc..

 DC inverters and rectifier circuits.

 Darlington pair transistors where more than one transistors are connected in parallel for obtaining the high current from emitter to collector.

 It could be used as an amplifier for amplifying current ,voltage and power.
