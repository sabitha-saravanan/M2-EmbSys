### APPLICATIONS OF HOME AUTOMATION

•	The voice activated home automation system will help us to control different loads (electrical appliances) with simple voice commands.

•	This kind of system is very useful for people with disabilities.

•	Managing all of your home devices from one places.

•	Incresing energy efficiency

### APPLICATIONS OF HARDWARE

## Applications of Arduino UNO: 

 Arduino as a good device for developing interactive object, talking inputs from a variety of switches or sensors and controlling a variety of lights, motors and other outputs.

 Arduino can be stand alone or they can be connceted to a computer using USB.The arduino will be seen by the computer as a standard series interface.

 The arduino board is a microcontroller board which is a small circuit that contains whole computer and a small chip.

## Applications of HC-05:

	Wireless communication between two microcontrollers

	Communicate with laptop, desktops and mobile phones

	Data logging application 

	Consumer applications

	Wireless robots 

	Home Automation

## Applications of 1N4007 PN junction diode:

In general purpose rectification of power supplies, inverters, and freewheeling diodes application.

•	Power supplies. 

•	Battery chargers.

•	Voltage doublers.

•	Adapters.

•	Rectification.

•	Components protection.

•	Blocking incoming voltage where not required.

## Applications of 2N2222 Transistor:

 This 2N2222 transistor could be used in that loads where current is required more than 800mA'

 Motor drive circuits such as variable frequency drives (VFD) etc..

 DC inverters and rectifier circuits.

 Darlington pair transistors where more than one transistors are connected in parallel for obtaining the high current from emitter to collector.

 It could be used as an amplifier for amplifying current ,voltage and power.

## Applications of LCD(Liquid Crystal Display):

 The liquid crystal displays(LCD) are used in aircraft cockpit displays.

 It is used as a display screen in calculators.

 For displaying images used in digital cameras.

 The television in main applications of LCD.

 Mostly the computer monitor is made up of LCD.

 It is used in instrumental panel where all the lab instruments uses LCD screens for display.

 The LCD's are commonly used in al digital wrist watches for displaying time.
